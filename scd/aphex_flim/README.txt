One of my first SuperCollider tests

execute in this Order:

1. Synths and Patterns
2. GUI

You'll be able to start from the GUI

Comments:
Long code a lot of errors... but might give you an impression of handling patterns from a GUI.
Still, not everything works... so use it under your own risk.
Nowadays I wold do everythong dfferent, maybe more code-efficient ;-) but don't have time to correct all that.

Enjoy
